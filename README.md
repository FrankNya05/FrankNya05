# 👋 Hi, I'm Frank — Embedded Systems, FPGA & ML Enthusiast

I’m a Computer Engineering student passionate about **embedded systems**, **FPGA design**, and **low-level programming**.  
I also have a growing interest in **machine learning applied to signals and embedded systems**.  
I enjoy building systems that connect hardware and software, from VHDL architectures to microcontroller firmware and data-driven applications.
